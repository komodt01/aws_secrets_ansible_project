# AWS Secrets Manager Retrieval - Ansible Project

Perfect! The playbook ran successfully and retrieved your secret value from AWS Secrets Manager. The output shows:

- The playbook executed successfully
- The secret value was retrieved using boto3 
- The value "dev-123" was displayed in the debug output

Even though you got a warning about the Python interpreter (Ansible recommending its discovery path), the playbook still worked correctly with the specified interpreter.

## What Worked

1. We used the direct boto3 Python approach instead of the Ansible AWS module
2. Specified Python 3.9 as the interpreter
3. Used a simple command-line Python script to access Secrets Manager
4. Successfully retrieved and displayed the secret value

> The warning is just informational - you can ignore it since the playbook ran successfully. To suppress it, you could set `ansible_python_interpreter` in your `ansible.cfg` or inventory file instead of using the `-e` flag.
